      <h1>Never a Dull Moment - Student Life at GIKI</h1>
      <p>Life at GIKI is not all about academics and study alone. We know that students need a respite from their tough
        study schedules.
        This is necessary to re-invigorate their energies and for overall holistic development of the participants.
        Here is a list of the clubs and societies that are open to membership for all students.</p>

        <p>This society holds debates, declamation contests and literary evenings including sessions of poetry recitation.
           It also arranges participation of the GIK team in debates and declamation contests held by other universities. 
           A special item on its agenda is the student-teacher discussion usually held in the auditorium. 
           These collective sessions prove invaluable for self-assessment and a critical evaluation of the diverse aspects of the GIK life,
           and go a long way in promoting rapport between the students and the faculty</p>

        <p>Character Building Society is a society that has been established on the working principle of trying to
           incorporate a sense of a personality buildup amongst fellow beings. We tend to provide a platform of no
           t only encouraging a buildup of skills in your character arsenal but hope to instill and 
           inculcate myriads of technical skill developments that would prove helpful for you.

           student body in leading a better quality life.

        <p>Women in Pakistan have traditionally not played their due role in professional fields,
           but an evident change is gradually emerging. In fact, a quiet revolution is taking place in Pakistan.
            Women are determining the dynamics of this revolution and will certainly influence the economy of the 
            country in the coming decades. Amidst the challenges of the 21st century, women in Pakistan have chosen a
             focused agenda i.e. self-development and greater economic empowerment. </p>
